Astronomy student currently finishing the Master's degree thesis at Universidad de Concepci√≥n (UdeC), Chile, with theoretical background in star formation, numerical simulations, and astrochemistry. My research interests focus mainly on theoretical modeling of star and planet formation, the link between these processes, astrochemistry of important tracers and organic molecules, and cosmical origins of life.
